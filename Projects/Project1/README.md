🎓 Student Report Card System (Python)

This is a simple Python-based project that generates a student report card using basic Python concepts such as variables, data types, lists, tuples, operators, and conditional statements.

It takes a student’s details and subject marks as input, then calculates the total, percentage, and grade based on the marks.
